# APIs In Financial Planning
## Background

In this project, I focused on using APIs as part of the technical solution to create two financial analysis tools.

The first is a personal finance planner that allows users to visualize their savings composed of investments in shares and cryptocurrencies and to assess if they have enough money in an emergency fund.

The second tool is a retirement planning tool that uses the Alpaca API to fetch historical closing prices for a retirement portfolio composed of stocks and bonds, then runs Monte Carlo simulations to project the portfolio performance at 30 years. I then use the Monte Carlo data to calculate the expected portfolio returns given a specific initial investment amount.
